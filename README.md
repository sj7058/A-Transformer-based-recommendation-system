# A-Transformer-based-recommendation-system
This repository hosts the Transformer-based Recommendation System project developed as part of an internship program by IIT Bombay EDTech. The project aims to create an advanced recommendation system using transformer models, known for their efficacy in capturing complex patterns in data.
By leveraging cutting-edge transformer architectures, we strive to enhance the accuracy and personalization of recommendations, surpassing traditional methods like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
